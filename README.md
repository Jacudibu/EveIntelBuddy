# Eve Intel Buddy
This very minimalistic cross-platform console application keeps an eye on a chat channel of your choice and notifies you when one of your predefined words is posted by someone.

## Use Cases
#### Intel
You can set it up to track the Intel Channel of your Alliance and add surrounding Systems to your watchlist.

#### Bazars
If you want to purchase a 10/10 DED but don't want to waste time watching your respective escalation bazar channel, your new little buddy can do that for you. Just add 10/10 or 5/10 to your watchlist.

#### Anything, really.
Want to have a sound notification when someone mentions your name? Just watchlist yourself.

Want to be notified when someone mentions Cats? You know what to do by now.

## How it works
It's nothing too special - the Intel Buddy just keeps track of your Chat Logs (those need to be enabled in your settings).
